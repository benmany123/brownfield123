                    In recent years, the housing issues in Hong Kong have been becoming more and more serious. According to the Urban Reform Institute study in 2020, Hong Kong had the worldâ€™s least affordable housing market. Increasing the land supply is likely to be one of the methods to alleviate the housing issues. There were about 1414 hectares of active brownfield sites (Planning Department, Arup, 2019). If the potential brownfield in the New Territories could be investigated and developed, it may release a considerable amount of land.

                    The Northern Link (NOL) is one of the seven recommended railway schemes in the Railway Development Strategy 2014. The project comprises Kwu Tung (KTU) Station and construction of a 10.7-kilometre-long railway link between the existing Kam Sheung Road (KSR) Station of West Rail Line (WRL) and KTU Station. The MTRCL proposed that the construction of the NOL would be carried out in two phases. Phase 1 would be KTU Station on the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line; and Phase 2 would be the NOL Main Line between KSR Station and KTU Station, with three intermediate stations at San Tin, Ngau Tam Mei and Au Tau.
